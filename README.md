  Experiments were carried out on Iris data set to compare the performance of Kmeans and FCM algorithm, and image segmentation task was carried out on cifar10 data set to compare the performance of KMeans and FCM algorithm on this task.
KMeans.ipynb and CM.ipynb are the code and results of the experiments performed on the Iris dataset. segment.ipynb uses these two algorithms for image segmentation code and running results on cifar10 data set. The cifar10 data sets, please download in the link https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html, and direct decompression in the current directory. Image score.jpeg is an unsupervised clustering evaluation index found on the Internet, but this experiment mainly uses contour coefficient as an evaluation index. FIG. 1.png~4.png is the calculation formula of contour coefficient.
Python script file UI.py is a visual interface that I use tkinter to implement image import, and then display the results of image segmentation by KMeans and FCM at the same time, and can dynamically adjust the K value or C value. There are still a few bugs, but they have not been fixed. The images under image are random test cases that I found
